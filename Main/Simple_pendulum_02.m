length= 1;  % pendulum length in metres
g=9.8;  % acceleration due to gravity
npoints = 250;  % Discretize time into 250 intervals
dt = 0.04;  % time step in seconds
omega = zeros(npoints,1);  % initializes omega, a vector of dimension npoints X 1,to being all zeros
theta = zeros(npoints,1);  % initializes theta, a vector of dimension npoints X 1,to being all zeros
time = zeros(npoints,1);  % this initializes the vector time to being all zeros
theta(1)=0.2;  % you need to have some initial displacement, otherwise the pendulum will not swing

for step = 1:npoints-1  % loop over the timesteps
    omega(step+1) = omega(step) - (g/length)*theta(step)*dt;
    theta(step+1) = theta(step)+omega(step+1)*dt;  % note that
    % this line is the only change between
    % this program and the standard Euler method
    time(step+1) = time(step) + dt;
