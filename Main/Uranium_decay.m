% Solve the Equation  dN/dt = -N/tau

N_uranium_initial = 1000;  % initial number of uranium atoms
npoints = 100;  % Discretize time into 100 intervals
dt = 1e7;  % time step in years
tau=4.4e9;  % mean lifetime of 238 U

N_uranium = zeros(npoints,1); % initializes N_uranium, a vector of dimension npoints X 1,to being all zeros
time = zeros(npoints,1); % this initializes the vector time to being all zeros

N_uranium(1) = N_uranium_initial; % the initial condition, first entry in the vector N_uranium is N_uranium_initial
time(1) = 0; %Initialise time

for step = 1:npoints-1 % loop over the timesteps and calculate the numerical solution
    N_uranium(step+1) = N_uranium(step) - (N_uranium(step)/tau)*dt;
    time(step+1) = time(step) + dt;
end

% For comparison , calculate analytical solution
t = 0:1e8:10e9;
N_analytical = N_uranium_initial*exp(-t/tau);

% Plot both numerical and analytical solution
plot(time,N_uranium,'r',t,N_analytical,'b'); %plots the numerical solution in red and the analytical solution in blue
